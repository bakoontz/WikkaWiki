Wikka
---------------


A Wiki-esque website toolkit originally developed by Hendrik Mans named WakkaWiki.
Devolopment was forked by Jason Tourtelotte and renamed Wikka.

Not much to read here. For some quick installation instructions, please
check out INSTALL.

Most of the Wikka documentation is available online only. Please visit
the official Wikka documentation at <http://docs.wikkawiki.org>. You'll
find everything else there. (Eventually. :b)
