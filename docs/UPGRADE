UPGRADING FROM AN EARLIER VERSION:

Just unpack the new distribution archive wherever you need/want it; all you need from
your old Wakka installation is wakka.config.php. You can also just copy the new files
over the old ones, but be careful not to overwrite your old wakka.config.php or
any customizations you may have applied to the source files.

Once the files are in place, browse to your Wakka. The update script should show
up automatically.

Note: before you complete the update script, everybody who will browse to your Wakka
will see it, too. So if you run a relatively high traffic site, you may want to lock
down your Wakka installation temporarily by placing a file called "locked" into your
Wakka directory; once Wakka sees it, it will ask for a username ("admin") and a 
password (whatever you put into that file). Don't forget to remove the "locked" file
once you're done with upgrading!

More details, hopefully, on <http://www.wakkawiki.com>.
