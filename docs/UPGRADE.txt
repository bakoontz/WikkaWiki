Wikka: Upgrading from an earlier version
----------------------------------------

BACK UP YOUR DATABASE! BACK UP YOUR DATABASE!

Just unpack the new distribution archive wherever you need/want it; all you
need from your old Wikka installation is wikka.config.php. You can also
just copy the new files over the old ones, but be careful not to overwrite
your old wikka.config.php or any customizations you may have applied to the
source files.

Once the files are in place, browse to your Wikka. The update script should
show up automatically.

Note: before you complete the update script, everybody who will browse to
your Wikka will see it, too. So if you run a relatively high traffic site,
you may want to lock down your Wikka installation temporarily by placing a
file called "locked" into your Wikka directory; once Wikka sees it, it will
ask for a username ("admin") and a password (whatever you put into that
file). Don't forget to remove the "locked" file once you're done with
upgrading!
